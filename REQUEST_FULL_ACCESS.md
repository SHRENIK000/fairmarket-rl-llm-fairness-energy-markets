# Requesting Full Access to FairMarket-RL

The core FairMarket-RL code (including the full reinforcement learning training pipeline, detailed market simulator, and experimental datasets) is **not open-sourced by default**. We are open to collaborating and sharing the complete code with qualified researchers or partners on a case-by-case basis.

To request **gated access** to the private FairMarket-RL repository:

1. **Introduce Yourself:** Provide your name, affiliation, and position (e.g., "Jane Doe, PhD student at XYZ University in Computer Science").
2. **Intended Use Case:** Explain how you plan to use the FairMarket-RL code. Examples:
   - Academic research (please describe the research topic and how FairMarket-RL fits in).
   - Non-commercial experimentation or evaluation.
   - Potential collaboration or extension of the method.
3. **Agreement to Terms:** We generally require a signed **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** and an affirmation that the code will be used for **non-commercial research purposes only**. In your request, please acknowledge that you are willing to discuss and sign an NDA or similar agreement.
4. **Contact Us:** Send the above information via email to **shrenikj@umich.edu**. You may also CC a faculty sponsor or advisor if you're a student. Use a clear subject line like "Request for FairMarket-RL Full Access".

We will review your request and respond with next steps (which may include providing a private link or adding you to a private repository, after an NDA is in place). Response times may vary, so please be patient.

**Note:** Access to the full code is at the discretion of the project authors. We prioritize requests that align with our research goals and values (e.g., advancing fairness in AI, energy market research, etc.). Commercial use requests will likely be declined or redirected to a different licensing discussion.

Thank you for your interest in FairMarket-RL!
