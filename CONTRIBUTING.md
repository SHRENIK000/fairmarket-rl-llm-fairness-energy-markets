# Contributing to FairMarket-RL (Public)

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository is a trimmed-down public version of an active research project. As such, the scope for contributions is limited to the public-facing aspects (interfaces, documentation, and the toy demo). Nevertheless, we welcome feedback and minor contributions.

## Ways to Contribute
**1. Documentation Improvements:** If you find typos, unclear explanations, or missing information in the README or other docs, feel free to submit a pull request with improvements.

**2. Bug Reports:** If the toy demo or interface code has obvious bugs (e.g., crashes, incorrect outputs), please open an issue describing the problem. We appreciate help in identifying any issues in the provided code.

**3. Feature Requests (Limited):** You may suggest enhancements that make the public interface more useful. However, note that we will not accept requests to add the withheld core functionality into the public repo.

**4. Discussions:** For general questions about FairMarket-RL, you can use the Discussions tab (if enabled) or open an issue. We enjoy hearing about use cases or confusion points, as it helps us improve the documentation.

## Pull Request Guidelines
- **Scope:** PRs should be limited to the interface, demo, or documentation. Any attempt to re-implement the core algorithm or add proprietary data will be closed.
- **Fork & Branch:** Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and create a feature branch from the `main` branch.
- **Commit Messages:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
- **Sign the CLA:** If a Contributor License Agreement is required by our institution, we will ask you to sign one for significant contributions. (For minor doc fixes, this may not be necessary.)
- **Code Style:** Try to follow the coding style of the project. Keep code simple and readable. Avoid adding heavy dependencies.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability in the repository (e.g., an exposed secret or a dependency issue), please **do not file a public issue**. Instead, report it privately to the maintainers (contact information is in SECURITY.md). We will address it as soon as possible.

## Note on Core Code
We understand that some might be interested in contributing to the full FairMarket-RL algorithms. At this time, those parts are closed-source. We encourage you to reach out (via REQUEST_FULL_ACCESS.md) if you have collaboration ideas, but we cannot accept code contributions to components that are not present in this public repo.

Thanks for helping improve FairMarket-RL's public interface and documentation!
