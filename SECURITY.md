# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or any concern (such as an exposed secret, significant bug that could be exploited, etc.) in this repository, please **report it to us privately** first.

- Contact: Send an email to **shrenikj@umich.edu** with the subject "Security Vulnerability in FairMarket-RL".
- Include in your email: 
  - Description of the issue and its potential impact.
  - Steps or code to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
  - Any suggestions on how to address it, if you have them.
- Please do not publicly disclose the issue until we have addressed it or given you permission to do so. Responsible disclosure allows us to fix the problem before malicious actors might exploit it.

We take security issues seriously and will respond as quickly as we can. Although this is a research project with limited scope, we still want to ensure that our users (even of the demo) are safe.

## Dependent Libraries
This project has minimal dependencies. If vulnerabilities are discovered in any dependency, we will update the dependency or recommend users update as needed.

## Note
Because this repository is a partial release and does not include deployment of a live service, the security surface is limited. Nonetheless, we appreciate the community's help in keeping everything secure.
